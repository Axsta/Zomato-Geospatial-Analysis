Key Business Insights:
* Customer Preferences: Frequently mentioned items like chicken biryani, paneer butter masala, and fried rice indicate high demand for non-veg and North Indian cuisine.
* Service Expectations: Phrases like “value for money”, “home delivery”, and “pocket friendly” highlight key drivers of customer satisfaction beyond food quality.
* Location Strategy: Restaurant density is highest in central Bangalore, while outer areas show potential for new market entry due to lower competition.
* Sentiment Clarity Through Bigrams: Single-word analysis failed to capture sentiment effectively. Bi-gram analysis provided clearer insights into customer attitudes, especially around affordability and service quality.

Business Recommendations:
* Menu Design: Focus on popular items like chicken-based dishes and affordable meal combos.
* Expansion Planning: Target low-density, high-demand neighborhoods outside central Bangalore.
* Marketing Strategy: Emphasize affordability, quick delivery, and customer-favorite dishes in campaigns.
* Customer Experience: Monitor review patterns regularly to adapt to evolving preferences.
